# Markdown Site Renderer

Given a directory of markdown files render a web site with minimal configuration.

**NOTE:** Just project shell for now to get the CI/CD into place, then I'll start bringing code in.

## tl;dr

Copy package.json and gatsby-config.js from 
[gatsby-plugin-thingity-example](https://github.com/ianhomer/gatsby-plugin-thingity-example)
into the root of your directory with your markdown files in and run:

    npm install
    npm run develop

Then visit http://localhost:8000
